            <p>Eating a healthy diet is not about strict limitations, staying unrealistically thin, or depriving
                yourself of
                the foods you love. Rather, it’s about feeling great, having more energy, improving your health, and
                boosting your mood. Healthy eating doesn’t have to be overly complicated. The truth is that while some
                specific foods or nutrients have been shown to have a beneficial effect on mood,
                it’s your overall dietary pattern that is most important.
                The cornerstone of a healthy diet should be to replace processed food with real food whenever possible.
                Eating food that is as close as possible to the way nature made it can make a
                huge difference to the way you think, look, and feel. By using some simple tips, you can cut through the
                confusion and learn how to create—and stick to a tasty,varied, and nutritious diet that is as good for
                your
                mind and for your body.
                Making a sudden, radical changes, such as eating nothing but cabbage soup, can lead to short term weight
                loss.
                However, such radical changes are neither healthy nor a good idea and won’t be successful in the long
                run.
                Permanently improving your eating habits requires a thoughtful approach in which you reflect, replace,
                and
                reinforce.</p>



            <h3>Add More Fruit And Vegetables To Your Diet</h3>
            <p>Fruit and vegetables are low in calories and nutrient dense, which means they are packed with vitamins,
                minerals, antioxidants, and fiber. Focus on eating the recommended daily amount of at least five
                servings of
                fruit and vegetables and it will naturally fill you up and help you cut back on unhealthy foods. A
                serving
                is half a cup of raw fruit or veg or a small apple or banana, for example. Most of us need to double the
                amount we currently eat.</p>

            <h3>To increase your intake:</h3>
            <p>Add antioxidant-rich berries to your favorite breakfast cereal
                Eat a medley of sweet fruit—oranges, mangos, pineapple,
                grapes—for dessert</p>
            <p>Swap your usual rice or pasta side dish for a colorful salad
                Instead of eating processed snack foods, snack on vegetables such as carrots, snow peas, or cherry
                tomatoes
                along with a spicy hummus dip or peanut butter. While plain salads and steamed veggies can quickly
                become
                bland, there are plenty of ways to add taste to your vegetable dishes.</p>

            <p>Add color. Not only do brighter, deeper colored vegetables contain higher concentrations of vitamins,
                minerals and antioxidants, but they can vary the flavor and make meals more visually appealing. Add
                color
                using fresh or sundried tomatoes, glazed carrots or beets, roasted red cabbage wedges, yellow squash, or
                sweet, colorful peppers.

                Liven up salad greens. Branch out beyond lettuce. Kale, arugula,spinach, mustard greens, broccoli, and
                Chinese cabbage are all packed with nutrients. To add flavor to your salad greens, try drizzling with
                olive
                oil, adding a spicy dressing, or sprinkling with almond slices, chickpeas, a little bacon, parmesan, or
                goat
                cheese.</p>
